# DBH FAQ & Guides

List of common FAQ questions that have come up over the years.

---

## Donations & Premium Servers
### How do I get donator servers? How do I donate? How do I get better servers?
  - Donate at https://paypal.me/DanBotHosting (minimum $1, priced at `$0.50` per premium server).
  - Include your Discord ID in the notes. Open a ticket and provide a screenshot plus the transaction ID so staff can process it.
### What is the price of DBH VPN?
  - Free, with paid add-ons such as static IPs and premium locations (currently in development).

---

## Common Issues: 
### "No Space" error even with free disk. How do I fix it?
  - Known issue from RAID setup on the new SSDs; being worked on.
### Out-of-space errors when installing packages. How do I fix it?
  - Installs use a tempporary (temp) directory limited to 100MB on the host. Packages larger than that limit fail with out-of-space messages.
  - For the container TMPDIR workaround, see: [Fixing `EnvironmentError - No space left on device`](/guides/fixing-no-space-temp).

## Hosting Support
### Do you support Lavalink servers?
  - Yes. Limit RAM to 2GB.
### Node IPs?
  - Provided on request; check the panel or ask staff if you need specifics. We recommend running simple ping command in terminal:

  ```
  ping dono-01.danbot.host
  ```
### What hosts do we use?
  - Primarily CrunchBits and BerryByte, followed by OVHCloud and a few colocated VPS hosts.
### Having issues with the DBH Pterodactyl API?
  - Set the user agent to `DBH` when calling the API.
### Proxied domains not using HTTPS:
  - Enable Force HTTPS by unproxying/reproxying or switching Cloudflare from DNS-only to Proxied (orange cloud), then in SSL enable "Always HTTPS."

## Policies
### What are you not allowed to host?
  - See the full list [here](/policies/policy-list).
### What is the difference between Free Nodes and Donator Nodes?
  - Donator servers are paid and limited to donors or code claimers.
### What's the catch? Why is it free?
  - Started in 2016 to help friends test projects; it grew into a business and a learning platform for system administration. Using DBH helps it grow and supports ongoing learning.
### Why don't we change startup commands for users?
  - Avoids false anti-abuse flags and prevents unstable startup flags from harming servers or nodes.
### Why no additional allocations for servers?
  - Allocations control server counts; extra allocations would skew usage data.
### Why no RAM upgrades for Dono-02/Dono-04 servers?
  - Max RAM was raised from 4GB to 6GB; further increases are not available due to limited resources.
### What happens if you charge back via PayPal or your bank?
  - See [Chargeback Policy Here](/policies/chargeback).
### How do I appeal a ban or suspension?
  - See [Appeals Guide Here](/appealing-a-ban).

## Databases
### Postgres
  - Use `container` as the username. Connection string format:
    - `postgres://container:<PASSWORD>@<node>.danbot.host:<port>/postgres`
### MongoDB
  - Connection string format:
    - `mongodb://admin:password@nX.danbot.host:port/?authSource=admin`
  - Replace `X` with your node number (use `dono-0X` for donator nodes). The password is in the Startup tab; use your server's port.

--- 

## Node Status Meanings
### Wings offline
Panel access unavailable for your server.
### System offline
Node is offline; panel access and workloads are down.
### Maintenance
Node in maintenance; bot offline and panel access unavailable until it returns.
### Online
Node healthy and ready to use.
